		<h3 id="discourse" class="subsub">Current Discourse</h3>

			<p>Historically, intellectuals have grappled with how, exactly, to represent the Holocaust. Many discuss the "unrepresentability" of the Holocaust. In Alain Resnais&#146s <cite>Night and Fog</cite>, the narrator Michel Bouquet, addresses the audience:</p>

				<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Who does know anything? The reality of these camps, despised by those who built them, and unfathomable to those who endured them - what hope do we have of truly capturing this reality?<sup><a href= "#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></p></blockquote>

			<p>Bouquet appeals to an idea that we can never express the suffering of those systematically dehumanized and killed; that the state of emotions felt by victims and survivors cannot be replicated without the context of concentration camps and murder, and that any film which attempts to do so is inherently lacking. Despite this, filmmakers (including Resnais himself), have been representing the Holocaust in film since the end of <abbr title="Second World War" class="abbr">WWII</abbr>, and rather than merely struggling with "unrepresentability," they have also grappled with gendered representations of the Holocaust.</p>

			<p>These early filmmakers of Holocaust documentaries fail to address the totality of the Holocaust, and they reinforce stereotypes surrounding the Holocaust by failing to consider the unique experiences had by Jewish women. They fail to explore the intersection of sexism and antisemitism, wherein Jewish women were made vulnerable to rape and sexual assault. Within these documentaries, Jewish women&#146s bodily and psychological trauma are rarely explored, and furthermore Jewish women rarely discuss their own bodies. However, Holocaust filmmaking has been evolving, and more recently women have been given more emphasis as narrators and interviews with women have been used as essential documentary material.</p>

			<p>Following trends in Holocaust historiography, many early documentaries focus solely on men&#146s experiences, or a broad Holocaust narrative which fails to address individual experiences. Even within the academic study of Holocaust history itself, it was not until the 1990s that academics focused on gender-oriented research. Work by major scholars such as Judy Baumel, Myrna Goldenberg, Dalia Ofer, Joan Ringelheim, and Carol Rittner established an understanding of the Holocaust that focused on understanding the ways in which gender engendered different experiences for men and women. This flew in the face of established thought; critics argued that Jewish women were murdered for their Jewishness, not for being women, and that antisemitism and the Nazi Final Solution did not distinguish between men and women.</p>

			<p>Gabriel Schoenfeld, a writer featured in the <cite>New York Times</cite>, the ex-editor of <cite>Commentary</cite>, and author of <cite>The Return of Anti-Semitism</cite>, charged that by focusing on women and comparing their experiences to men, feminist historians were using the Holocaust <q>explicitly to serve the purposes of conscious-raising (i.e., propaganda)</q> which <q>is, as happens, something its practitioners proudly admit, just as they are proud of their use of the Holocaust as a means of validating feminist theory itself.</q><sup><a href = "#fn2" id="rf2">2</a></sup> Gabriel Schoenfeld does not consider the feminist movement valid, especially within Holocaust studies, and directly accuses Joan Ringelheim and Debra Kaufmann of using the Holocaust to advance their academic careers. He expresses a fear that accusation of sexism towards the Nazis would somehow derail conversations about antisemitism, and that labeling Jewish men sexist will lump them in with the Nazis. These are all baseless fears, however, as not a single scholar has ever had the gall to lump Jewish men with the Nazis; to do so would be not only grossly ahistorical, but also supremely unethical. It seems that it is Schoenfeld himself who that carries the bias, which is especially visible when he describes feminists as if they were <q>zealous and accusatory</q> vultures.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup></p>

			<p>On the opposing side of Schoenfeld, Naama Shik, in an article discussing the trends in gender-oriented historiography, argues that questioning gender-oriented research is <q>no longer relevant.</q><sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup> Shik claims that the contributions of gender-oriented research, along with the participation of top scholars, international conferences, popular books, and huge exhibitions prove that gender issues really are at the core of contemporary research. Weitzman and Ofer point out that <q>questions of gender lead us to a richer and more finely nuanced understanding of the Holocaust.</q><sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup> Without the narratives of women, we are unable to understand the totality of Nazi dehumanization &mdash; that Jewish people were not just denied their humanity, but that the dehumanization both led to destruction of their gender identities and that degendering itself was a contributor in dehumanization. Without women&#146s narratives, it is impossible to fully grasp the system of forced labor which singled out women with children and pregnant women for extermination. It is also impossible to understand the massive exploitation of Jewish people in the form of slave labor without considering the role of women as sex slaves, in brothels and otherwise. And perhaps most importantly, without gender-oriented study, it is impossible to understand how women have suffered and why many have done so in silence. To assume that Jewish men&#146s experience during the Holocaust &mdash; in ghettos, in labor camps, and in death camps &mdash; is the default experience for all victims of the Holocaust is erroneous.</p>

			<p>The neglect of women&#146s gender-specific experience is a piece of a much wider-spanning problem. In film and popular culture, Jewish victims &mdash; usually men &mdash; are always depicted in the same ways: striped pajamas and tattooed. This is despite the fact that prison garb vastly varied and tattooing was not a feature of all camps; tattooing did not apply at all to those sent to death camps and gassed upon arrival. In popular fictional narratives, very little distinction is made between a concentration (labor, collection and transit, and prisoner of war) camps and extermination camps, and ghettos are either excluded or confused with concentration camps. Furthermore, vastly more victims of the Holocaust were killed in the very homes and villages they lived in, shot in the killing fields of the east and buried in unmarked graves.</p>

			<p>An extreme emphasis is placed on Auschwitz, perhaps due to the influential early English narratives of Primo Levi, Anne Frank, and Elie Wiesel. This can also be contributed to the fact that Auschwitz, as a combination of labor and extermination camp, had a number of survivors, especially among Hungarian Jewish people, who were not deported from Hungary until spring of 1944. This primary public focus on one concentration camp has also contributed to a homogenization of popular narrative, especially dangerous in this case given that very few camps were an official combination of labor and extermination.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> Given this trend and the lack of early English translations of narratives by women, this neglect of women is, in part, due to two assumptions: first, that Holocaust narratives are stereotypical, and secondly, that the monolithic Holocaust stereotype is purely based on men&#146s experiences.</p>

		<h3 class="subsub" id="methods">Methods and Process</h3>

			<p>This paper seeks to outline the ways that Jewish women&#146s narratives are presented by documentary filmmakers, the development of these gender-related themes in documentaries, and to compare these presentations with primary sources written by Jewish women. For the sake of brevity, only a few films will be discussed at length. They have been chosen for their historical significance, their availability to the general public (streaming, or on daytime television), and their popularity and will be reviewed for their inclusion or exclusion of survivor testimonies, specifically women&#146s&#146 testimonies. These are Resnais&#146s <cite>Night and Fog</cite>, Lanzmann&#146s <cite>Shoah</cite>, Schwartzman&#146s <cite>Genocide</cite>, the episode <q>Genocide: 1942-1945</q> from <cite>The World At War</cite>, <cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite> by Kary Antholis, the 1997 <abbr title="British Broadcasting Network" class="abbr">BBC</abbr> mini-series by Laurence Rees <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> directed by Laurence Rees, James Moll&#146s <cite>The Last Days</cite> (1998), Laurence Rees&#146s series <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite>, and <cite>The Lady in Number 6</cite>.</p>

			<p>Given the different stylistic and narrative approaches taken in the documentaries, they will have to be assessed in different ways. Exclusion of survivor testimony in Resnais&#146s <cite>Night and Fog</cite> lends the film to a critical analysis of its visual presentation and narrative choices while the use of survivor testimony as read by Elizabeth Taylor in Schwartzman&#146s <cite>Genocide</cite> must be analyzed for how the testimony is presented, both with its visual accompaniments and audio itself. <cite>The World At War</cite> and <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> are about the <abbr title="Second World War" class="abbr">WWII</abbr> in general, they must be analyzed episodically. <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite>, a documentary literally about Auschwitz, must be assessed for how it portrays the diverse population and experiences of Auschwitz. Lanzmann&#146s <cite>Shoah</cite> must be analyzed for the interviews chosen and the interviews that did not make the cut &mdash; three hundred and fifty hours of footage<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>, were shot in preparation of the film, yet only nine and a half hours were ultimately used. Moll&#146s <cite>The Last Days</cite> must be assessed for how it uses survivor testimony to form a narrative. Finally, <cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite> and <cite>The Lady in Number 6</cite> must be assessed for the way individual survivor testimony can be used to assert the diversity of experience, rather than a mythological or legendary one.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup></p>

			<p>The first half of this paper will provide historical context for the narratives of popular documentaries using the narratives of Jewish survivors. Translations of English narratives by Jewish women have only become accessible in the last twenty years, as many women have been encouraged to tell their stories and academia (as well as the public) have just recently become more interested in women&#146s literature. I have chosen Dr. Gisela Perl&#146s <cite>I Was a Doctor in Auschwitz</cite> (first published in 1948, available in English in 1979), Olga Lengyel&#146s <cite>Five Chimneys: A Woman Survivor&#146s True Story of Auschwitz</cite> (first published in 1946, available in English in 1995), Lucille Eichengreen&#146s <cite>Ashes to Life: Memories of the Holocaust</cite> (1994), Gerda Weissmann Klein&#146s <cite>All But My Life</cite> (first published in 1957, later republished with expansions in 1995), various interviews with women collected by Brana Gurewitsch in <cite>Mothers, Sisters, Resisters: Oral Histories of Women Who Survived the Holocaust</cite> (1998), and excerpts of pieces written by various women collected in Carol Rittner and John K. Roth&#146s <cite>Different Voices: Women in the Holocaust</cite> (1993).<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> These texts have been chosen because they give a fairly broad scope of the Holocaust, usually detailing life before deportation, the process of deportation, and their internment in various camps. It is through a discussion of these texts that we can understand that women had specific experiences from life in regular neighborhoods, to life in the ghetto, to life and death in concentration camps of all sorts, and extermination camps.</p>

	<h2 class="subheading" id="history">History of Jewish Women Under Nazi Persecution</h2>
		<h3 class="subsub" id="society">Jewish Women in German Society</h3>

			<p>Broadly felt by all Jewish people in Germany were the antisemitic laws passed in 1935, just after Hitler rose to power. The Nuremberg Laws defined Jewishness (creating a dichotomy that dividied German national identity from Jewish ethnic/religious identity) and forbade the marriage between Germans and Jewish people. These laws helped <q>other</q> Jewish people within German society. But women felt and responded to the antisemitic animosity of their neighbors before their husbands. Marion Kaplan notes that Jewish women were more aware of the climate of antisemitism because <q>women were more integrated into and dependent upon the community and more accustomed to neighborly exchanges and courtesies.</q><sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup> Both sexes faced discrimination in the streets, in the shops, and in their occupational fields as their social circles fell apart. However, Jewish women, as housewives, had unique stresses put upon them due to their regulation to the domestic sphere.</p>

			<p>Jewish women had to maintain a household with a limited budget, had to manage shopping and hostile shop-keeps, had to find ways around the ban of Kosher slaughtering (either by purchasing black-market meats or staunch vegetarianism), and had to support their families all the while raising their children (comforting them after antisemitic bullying by their peers), soothing their frustrated husbands, taking care of their elderly relatives, and keeping a generally positive atmosphere to the household. Very few men participated in the domestic chores, they were only asked to <q>limit their expectations.</q><sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup></p>

			<p>Women would also petition government officials to release their husbands from custody after the November pogrom (<i lang="de">Kristallnacht</i>), navigating the bureaucratic system by themselves and organizing a means to escape abroad. <i lang="de">Kristallnacht</i> was the high-water mark of Nazi persecution, prior to the events of the Holocaust, signifying the intent of the Nazi state in a very palpable way with the state-sponsored destruction of Jewish businesses. Doris Bergen cites that <q>[t]hose men seized in the <i lang="de">Kristallnacht</i> pogrom were the first Jewish people in Germany arrested simply for being Jewish.</q><sup><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> The first concentration camps were established very early on, such as Dachau in 1933, although they were used to house criminals, such as homosexuals and mainly political dissenters, such as communists and Jehovah&#146s Witnesses, who were considered draft-dodgers. With further legislation, the camp populations would be expanded. After the German annexed Austria, German and Austrian Jewish people could expect to be imprisoned in Dachau, Buchenwald, and Sachsenhausen, especially following the <i lang="de">Kristallnacht</i> pogrom, when Jewish men were systematically arrested and incarcerated. The wives could only free their husbands if they could present papers of immigration. Ruth Abraham traveled to Dachau on a bus full of <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> men to petition the release of her father-in-law, and after interviewing the camp commandant and pleading for his life, he was freed with the intercession of a <abbr title="Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei" class="abbr">NSDAP</abbr> member.<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup></p>

			<p>Kaplan cites that Jewish women warned their husbands of the poisonous atmosphere, especially following <i lang="de">Kristallnacht</i>. Kaplan gives us the example of Inge Deutschkron&#146s mother, whom insisted upon burning every piece of leftist material in their house, despite the skepticism and hesitation of her husband: <q>and Mother, who&#146d always been the more practical of the two and had developed a nose for danger, would respond almost gruffly.</q><sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup> Though these Jewish women frequently advised immigration, more men escaped than women. This is for a number of reasons, including the fact that women had a higher chance of becoming employed, that men would be expected to immigrate first and the women would follow, and that women had a number of obligations. Much of the response also had to do with age. Women could still find jobs, though in limited fields. They could work in social services as teachers, nurses, and administrators and older Jewish women could work in cultural occupations within the Jewish community. Jewish women were expected to learn new skills and become employed as seamstresses, housekeepers, and other domestic workers so to provide for their families.<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup> Young men were also more often sent away, due to the role that men should establish futures for themselves and women should marry.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup> Daughters were also compelled to remain with their families, or what was left of them, to take care of their elderly relatives.</p>

			<p>We see that, prior to being forced into ghettos, women were saddled with many difficult tasks. Women worked to release their husbands from imprisonment and Nazi racial laws which removed men from their political offices and their jobs oftentimes forced women to become not only keeper of the domestic sphere but oftentimes the primary breadwinners to support their families and feed their children. Women, specifically, felt pressed not to immigrate to other countries, so that they may look after elderly relatives and children.</p>

		<h3 class="subsub" id="ghettos">Jewish Women in the Ghettos</h3>

			<p>After the German invasion of Poland, the first ghettos were erected. Ghettos varied in type depending on region, so that some areas had ghettos without walls, and some were sealed ghettos, with extremely poor living conditions; a very small percentage were extermination ghettos, or ghettos lasting no more than six weeks where Jewish people were concentrated so that they may be shot. These extermination ghettos were founded in the late days of the war in Nazi-occupied Soviet regions and in Hungary. German Jewish people were typically not forced into ghettos, but were forced to wear the Star of David and live in designated areas. It was not until 1941 that Hitler authorized the mass deportation of Jewish people from Germany into Jewish ghettos.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup> In every Nazi-occupied territory, especially in Poland, Jewish people were forced tiny and unsanitary living quarters.</p>

			<p>The experiences women faced in their regular neighborhoods, the struggle of managing resources and raising children, would be made even more difficult in the context of ghettos. Universally, sanitation was an issue. Christopher Browning remarks in his <cite>The Origins of the Final Solution: The Evolution of Nazi Jewish Policy 1939-1942</cite>, that most of the apartments of &#x141;&#243;d&#378; ghetto lacked running water or sewers, resulting in hundreds of thousands dying to disease, and countless others starving to death as a result of rationed food.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> Michal Unger notes, <q>women were paid less [than men] even when they worked on equal terms with the men.</q><sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> The fact that men did not work to the scale of Jewish women is largely due to Jewish men being trained in one occupational skill, something they had built up their entire lives. The loss of their occupations could only be described as catastrophic, not only financially but also to their self-esteems. These men in the ghettos, unable to provide for their families, <q>experienced ghetto life as a constant reminder of their failure to live up to their traditional masculine roles.</q><sup><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup></p>

			<p>Furthermore, Dalia Ofer remarks that women became responsible for such tasks as <q>standing in line for bread or water, obtaining permission to retrieve personal belongings from confiscated homes, or repairing damaged businesses.</q><sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>  On top of that, Liza Chapnik offhandedly states that, <q>[m]embers of the Gestapo would come to the ghetto &mdash; alone or with friends &mdash; for entertainment. This entertainment consisted of taking potshots at a child, raping a woman, cutting the beard off an old man, humiliating people in the street, and so on. This was everyday life in the ghetto.</q><sup><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup> Women had to make a home in unsanitary conditions, with very little food, taking care of children, oftentimes acting as breadwinners, and with the ever present threat of sexual violence.</p>

		<h3 class="subsub" id="concentration_camps">Jewish Women in Concentration Camps</h3>

			<p>It was not until 1942 that there is a marked shift in Nazi policy towards the Jewish people. The first Jewish people were deported from their ghettos in Poland to Chelmno, Treblinka, Belzec, and other extermination camps. Every Jewish person, regardless of age or gender, could expect to be sent to a concentration camp or be killed on the spot. This is not to say that Nazi policy had not been eradicating populations of people prior to 1942. After the invasion of Poland, the <i lang="de">Einsatzgruppen</i> travelled in the wake of the German army, razing villages, inciting pogroms, and massacring Jewish people. Initially, the targets of these shootings were adult, Jewish men, however the elderly, women and children were regularly included. Most of those targeted by the <i lang="de">Einsatzgruppen</i> and those local population employed by the Nazis did not live, and so untold numbers of Jewish people lie in unmarked graves across Eastern Europe.</p>

			<p>While extermination camps did exist, the vast majority of camps were labor camps. Labor camps could exist as autonomous, single camps or as satellites to extermination camps, or could be just a temporary camp. There were also collection camps, where massive amounts of Jewish people would be temporarily held, and transit camps, where they would be routed to main camps, whether labor or extermination. The vast majority of survivors are from labor camps, or camps that were a combination of labor and extermination such as Auschwitz.</p>

			<p>In discussing women&#146s very specific experiences in the camps, it is important to understand what women perceive constitutes female identity. To designate womanhood to women on the basis of their sexual attributes essentializes feminine experience and ignores the importance of gender as a social construct or self-identification. For many women, appearance was just as important as genitals and secondary sexual characteristics, such as the styling of their hair, clothing and their hygienic behaviors. Nonetheless, it is important to understand that many women associated their sexual attributes (the presence of menstruation, breasts, feminine distribution of weight, etc.), pregnancy and motherhood as essential facets of their identity as women.</p>

			<p>Brigitte Halbmayr cites Marta Kos, who said the shaving of her hair left <q>the deepest impression of all the time spent in the concentration camp.</q><sup><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup> Many women dwell on the shaving of their heads and body hair within their memoirs. Lucille Eichengreen recalls that she <q>was close to hysterics. If only I could hide my head. Would my hair ever grow back? Would there be time?</q><sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup> Of all bodily things, Lucille Eichengreen fixates on the loss of her hair. Later in her narrative, she tells of stealing a scarf so that her head is not bare, an act which could have cost her life. Monika J. Flaschka gives us a passage by Isabella Leitner, a survivor of Auschwitz, who remarks that after liberation it was an uncanny sensation to comb her hair again. Notably, she says, <q>[w]ith our newly found womanhood, we attract the attention of the men of our world.</q><sup><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup> The act of shaving a woman&#146s hair has many more implications than shaving the hair of a man. Not only is it a dehumanizing act, it is also a degendering act specifically affecting women.</p>

			<p>Many had different theories of how the Nazis were diminishing the strength and sexual potency of the inmates. Miriam Rosenthal commented in an interview that the Germans were giving the inmates bromine in the food.<sup><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup> Livia E. Bitton Jackson also relayed that <q>[t]ere is bromide in our food, we are told by old-timers.</q><sup><a href="#fn27" id="ref27">27</a></sup> She goes on to say that the supposed bromide made many married women anxious, wondering if they would ever bear children again. It is likely the Nazis were not using bromide, because despite the fact that it was traditionally used as a sedative, no survivors document the side effects of bromide poisoning typical of long-term use/abuse. Regardless, the effects of starvation caused amenorrhea (the cessation of menstruation) and rendered victims practically sexless in appearance.  Livia E. Bitton gives a vivid description:</p>

				<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The breasts began to sag at first and then became virtual hanging sacks. Some very fat ladies had the most ridiculously hanging empty sacks, like long, narrow, stretched-out empty balloons weighed down by a single marble in each, reaching almost to the navel. Then the empty sacks became shorter. Eventually the skin, too, was absorbed and the breasts disappeared completely. We were all like men. Flat.<sup><a href="#fn28" id="ref28">28</a></sup></p></blockquote>

			<p>In this way, purposeful starvation can also be understood as an assault on women&#146s gender identities. Women struggled with their masculinization and the cessation of their reproductive capacities which they felt defined them, bodily, as women.</p>

		<h3 class="subsub" id="narratives">Women's Narratives and Sexual Violence</h3>

			<p>While some women&#146s narratives have been edited by men, many women have also felt pressured to omit depictions of sexual abuse and sexual violence, both because of shame and the belief that their suffering detracted to the <q>bigger picture</q> of the Holocaust. Nomi Levenkron quotes Ruth Bondy: <q>[t]his subject (sexual molestation) attracts far more attention than that of the slaughter but is inconsequential compared with all that happened. If two million Jewish women were murdered during the Holocaust, sexual molestation was the lot of a few but violence was the lot of the many.</q><sup><a href="#fn29" id="ref29">29</a></sup> Yet despite this, many women, in veiled language, discuss sexual molestation and rape in their memoirs.</p>

			<p>Eva Fogelman recalls that when Joan Ringelheim and Esther Katz organized a conference in 1983 for women survivors, there were disagreements on the nature of rape in the Holocaust. Historian Sybil Milton claimed that rape could not have been common due to the prohibition on racial defilement that prevented <q>Aryans</q> from copulating with <q>non-Aryans</q>. Vera Laska, a Holocaust survivor and resistance leader in Hungary and Czechoslovakia disagreed and also pointed out that this law did not prevent Poles, Ukrainians, and Latvian partisans and auxiliaries to the <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> from committing these crimes. The survivors at the conference also disagreed, citing their unappealing appearance as grounds that they could not be considered sexual objects, therefore no one would have wanted to rape them.<sup><a href="#fn30" id="ref30">30</a></sup> What the conference held in 1983 tells us is that the women who survived held beliefs about rape that ostracized and shamed survivors who had been sexually abused and raped. Levenkron grimly remarks that <q>[i]t is far easier to count the number of skeletons than the number of those raped: skeletons are far more tangible and visible, but the living women who were raped hide, for they fear the stigma that is likely to cling to them if they reveal what was done to them.</q><sup><a href="#fn31" id="ref31">31</a></sup></p>

			<p>In an uncommonly early piece, <cite lang="de">Herr Kapt&#228;in</cite>, by Irena Kapfisz, sexual violence perpetrated against Jewish women is referenced:</p>
				<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>he was hard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so hard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forcing bending me<br />till I could not breathe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;slamming against me<br />my mouth was filled with terror&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i was pierced<br /> in two&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when he suddenly pulled out<sup><a href="#fn32" id="ref32">32</a></sup></p></blockquote>

			<p>Although Irena Kapfisz did not experience this firsthand, the fact that she would choose to write about gendered sexual violence is telling. It tells us that as a woman, her conceptualization of the Holocaust included notions of graphic sexual violence. It is difficult to say if Kapfisz herself was the victim of sexual violence or if this is something she observed, however most of her writings on the Holocaust are framed personal narratives that have been fictionalized.</p>

			<p>Commonly we see sexual assault in veiled language, such as in Olga Lengyel&#146s <cite>Five Chimneys</cite>. Lengyel says that upon being admitted to Auschwitz, a <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> officer ordered that her head not be shaven, however she reasoned that <q>from this foe one could expect no mercy, except at an ugly price. I did not want to be preferred; it was better to stay with my companions. I disregarded the order, and got into line to be shorn.</q><sup><a href="#fn33" id="ref33">33</a></sup> Felicja Karay claims that in the Polish work camps of Skarżysko-Kamienna, <q>there were well known cases of individual and collective rapes of Jewish women.</q> She gives the example of Commander Fritz Bartenschlager who took five women to his apartment to serve his guests at a dinner party in the nude.<sup><a href="#fn34" id="ref34">34</a></sup>More commonly than veiled language, sex is not mentioned at all, despite the role of sex in the economy of the camp system.</p>

			<p>Gisela Perl touches on the topic of selling one&#146 s body. When she was in Auschwitz, she was given a pair of men&#146s shoes, however they had no laces. She approached a man, looking to trade her bread ration for a piece of string. In exchange, he wanted sex. <q>He wasn&#146t listening to me. <q>Hurry up...hurry up....</q> he said hoarsely. His hand, filthy with the human excrement he was working in, reached out for my womanhood, rudely, insistently.</q><sup><a href="#fn35" id="ref35">35</a></sup> For both Lengyel and Perl, and for countless other women, their survival sometimes came at the ugliest price. In the economy of Auschwitz, just like every other camp, sex was a regularly traded commodity. Brothels were founded by the Nazis and female prisoners, who had been promised some better treatment, staffed them. <i lang="de">Kapos</i> and other collaborative prisoners could be rewarded with coupons for good behavior.</p>

			<p>Lesbians were also persecuted by the Nazis, although not to the degree of male homosexuals. German legal code did not officially criminalize lesbianism, however many lesbians were swept up in the raids of bars and clubs, while others were denounced by their neighbors. The police categorized the lesbians as asocial, which included the mentally ill or disabled, as well as the homeless, alcoholics, sex workers, and those who were <q>work shy.</q> However, very few lesbians were sent to concentration camps strictly for being lesbian. Many lesbians happened to be political dissenters or Jewish.<sup><a href="#fn36" id="ref36">36</a></sup> Vera Laska comments that <q>[t]here were without a doubt hundreds of Lesbian relationships in the camps</q> and <q>[i]f a woman had a position of eminence in the camp hierarchy, such as a block senior or <i lang="de">Kapo</i>, with separate quarters, chances were better for such friendships to evolve into a sexual relationship.</q><sup><a href="#fn37" id="ref37">37</a></sup></p>

			<p>Very few, if any explicit consensual lesbian relationships exist in women&#146s narratives. However, we find the sexual abuse of Jewish women by fellow inmates and female <i lang="de">Kapos</i>, who could extract sex for favors. Olga Lengyel reports that Irma Griese, a German guard, <q>frequently had homosexual relationships with inmates and then ordered the victims to the crematory.</q><sup><a href="#fn38" id="ref38">38</a></sup> However, it is worth noting that no other narrative gives this impression of Irma Griese, and the sexualization of her crimes may point to the larger issue wherein violence perpetrated by women is seen as an act of sexual sadism.</p>

			<p>Women also speak of rape and sexualized humiliation at the hands of the male guards. The <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> were not above <q>race-defilement</q> as Sibil Milton has suggested. Lucille Eichengreen tells of how a rust-red scarf rolled up between her legs prevented a soldier from raping her. <q>My head was still in his viselike grip as his hand came to stop between my legs. He fingered the scarf. I stopped breathing, convinced that my life was over. Suddenly, he shouted in my ear, <q>you filthy, useless bitch! Pfui! Menstruating!</q> He pushed me away in disgust.</q><sup><a href="#fn39" id="ref39">39</a></sup> Women would frequently be forced to stand in the nude for punishment. During the <i lang="de">Selektion</i> process, inmates would be forced to strip and run past <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> officers and camp doctors. When Olga Lengyel speaks of the cavity searches the victims were subjected to upon arrival at Auschwitz, she comments that it was all done <q>in the presence of drunken soldiers who sat around the table, chuckling obscenely.</q><sup><a href="#fn40" id="ref40">40</a></sup> While the women felt degendered and dehumanized by their nudity, their shaven heads, and amenorrhea, they were sexualized by other inmates and by the <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> guarding them.</p>

		<h3 class="subsub" id="children">Women and their Children in Camps</h3>

			<p>Mothers, along with looking after themselves within camps, also had to act in the welfare of their children. Rita Grunbaum, a Jewish woman living in the Netherlands, tells of her deportation to Poland. Despite the fact that her daughter, Dorien, was not on the deportation list, the couple did not want to leave their thirteen-month old child behind. Once they had arrived in Westerbork, a Dutch transfer camp on the line to Auschwitz, their daughter developed polio, probably from one of the many sick within the transport. Rita Grunbaum&#146s testimony focuses almost entirely on the health of her child, and much of her time in the camps was spent nursing her child back to health and working to support her child.<sup><a href="#fn41" id="ref41">41</a></sup> Women were also forced to kill their children to survive. Lidia Rosenfeld Vago met a Belgian woman with bound breasts in a hospital, when she asked what had happened to her, the woman told her that she was pregnant and beginning to show. She bound her breasts so that she would not be immediately gassed. She gave birth in the camp, but her child was taken from her and killed.<sup><a href="#fn42" id="ref42">42</a></sup> Upon deportation to extermination camps, women were murdered on the basis of not just being Jewish, but also as women. After being sent to the extermination camps, women who were pregnant or were mothers were immediately exterminated. Many mothers who were not felt the burden of their children&#146s death upon them, such as Olga Lengyel, who in the opening paragraphs of her <cite>Five Chimneys</cite>, discusses the guilt she has because she unwittingly sent her parents and her two sons to the gas chambers.<sup><a href="#fn43" id="ref43">43</a></sup> The sexist discrimination which had devalued women&#146s labor in a way that resulted in lower pay transformed into grounds for extermination.</p>

		<h3 class="subsub" id="relationships">Women and Homosocial Interactions</h3>

			<p>The vast majority of men attribute their survival to a combination of luck or sheer (masculine) willpower. Women, by contrast, emphasize the importance of their lasting friendships, or even romantic or sexual relations. Gertrud Sandmann, a Jewish lesbian, survived the Holocaust because of her relationship with a German woman, Hedwig.<sup><a href="#fn44" id="ref44">44</a></sup> Gerda Weissmann Klein credits her friendships with her survival, and in fact, most of her memoir centers on her friendships.<sup><a href="#fn45" id="ref45">45</a></sup> Myrna Goldenberg claims that many women&#146s survival depended on the formation of surrogate families or sisterhoods.<sup><a href="#fn46" id="ref46">46</a></sup> Isabella Leitner specifically states that these relationships were burdens which encouraged them to live, despite it all.<sup><a href="#fn47" id="ref47">47</a></sup> While many women recognized that they survived due to <q>dumb luck,</q> they tend to also recognize that forming near-familial bonds played some role in the preservation of their will to survive. Primo Levi, in his <cite>Survival in Auschwitz</cite>, comments that those who are doomed fail to maintain their hygiene, lose their human dignity, and eventually die. Goldenberg claims that, <q>[e]ssentially, as women cleaned their surroundings, sewed pockets into their ragged clothes, created menus to mitigate their hunger, nursed and nurtured one another, they created the illusion of taking some measure of both control and responsibility for their well-being.</q><sup><a href="#fn48" id="ref48">48</a></sup></p>

		<h3 class="subsub" id="summary">Summary: Women's Experiences</h3>

			<p>In summary, the experiences of Jewish women during the Holocaust differed in critical ways those of Jewish men. Due to close contact with the surrounding Gentile community, many Jewish women were more aware of the antisemitic climate in Germany. Many Jewish women would encourage their husbands to leave the country. In response to men being ousted from their jobs, Jewish women often learned trades and helped provide for the family while maintaining the household and looking after children and/or their parents. Women also helped their husbands obtain the documentation to leave early prison camps. Upon deportation, many mothers had to make difficult choices for the welfare of their children. They had to provide for them in an increasingly impossible environment and to treat their childhood sicknesses. Mothers were torn from their children or were gassed with them. Pregnant mothers were singled out and murdered.</p>

			<p>The act of shaving Jewish women&#146s&#146 hair was not just a dehumanizing act &mdash; turning an entire group into a mass &mdash; but also a degendering one. This degendering was heightened by the effects of starvation on the figure and on menstruation and fertility. While men also had their heads shaven and lived with the same starvation, the act of hair-shaving did not remove a particularly gendered physical feature and no Jewish men cited that being starved made them feel not-male. That is not to say that men were not degendered &mdash; indeed, the act of removing them as breadwinners and denying them any form of autonomy was an emasculating act &mdash; it is simply to say that women and men were denied their gender identities in differing ways, ways that ultimately denied them their humanity.</p>

			<p>Many more women give instances of sexual assault or near-rape. This gives the impression that Jewish women faced higher instances of rape, sexual coercion and general sexual violence than men. Many more women also discuss the barter system of the camps, which indicates that women saw the sex-for-survival as perhaps more degrading than their male counterparts. Sexual assault came from not just other concentration camp inmates, but from German soldiers &mdash; despite laws against racial mixing &mdash; and from <i lang="de">Kapos</i>, who could coerce women into sex with the promise of favors. The role of cavity searching, shaving women&#146s&#146 pubic hair, punishments by forcing women to be nude, and other forms of sexual humiliation were participated in and sexualized by male and female <i lang="de">Kapos</i> and guards. This is also not to say that Jewish men were not raped or molested, however sexual violence was not as often employed to degrade and dehumanize Jewish men. More often than not, however, sex is excluded from both women and men&#146s narratives. What we also see is an overlap of the categories of <q>victim</q> and <p>perpetrator,</q> even along gendered-lines, where women competed against one another to live and exploited one another for goods or favors. Survivors very often victimized others simply to live.</p>

<h2 class="subheading" id="documentaries">Holocaust Documentaries and Jewish Women</h2>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="timeline">Timeline of Documentaries</h3>

		<p>Filmmakers of Holocaust-related media originally sought to depict war crimes, and to call for the punishment of perpetrators. For these early filmmakers, Germans were the perpetrators, and Jewish people were universally victims. The first documentaries, made in the 1940s primarily focused on the Nuremberg trials and an expression of the camps from an American liberator perspective. Just a few of these films are Billy Wilder&#146s <cite>Death Mills</cite> (1945), George Stevens&#146s <cite>Nazi Concentration Camps</cite> (1945) and <cite>The Nazi Plan</cite> (1945)<sup><a href="#fn49" id="ref49">49</a></sup>, Gene Fowler&#146s <cite>Seeds of Destiny</cite>(1946), and Svilov&#146s <cite>The Nuremberg Trials</cite> (1947).<sup><a href="#fn50" id="ref50">50</a></sup> Alfred Hitchcock&#146s <cite>Memory of the Camps</cite>, which was unfinished but later reconstructed by <abbr title="Public Broadcasting Service" class="abbr">PBS</abbr>, also focused primarily on German crimes against humanity.<sup><a href="#fn51" id="ref51">51</a></sup> None of these documentaries used survivor testimony and they are primarily made of Nazi propaganda newsreel footage and the footage taken during the liberation of the camps by American, British, and Soviet forces with voice overs. The chief intention of these documentaries is to call for the punishment of Nazi war criminals.</p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="nightandfog">Alain Resnais: <cite>Night and Fog</cite></h3>

		<p>Following the war, there was a silence surrounding the Holocaust. Many Jewish survivors did not openly speak about their experiences. As such, only a few films were made in the 1950s. The most notable was Alain Resnais&#146s <cite>Night and Fog</cite> (1955). The narration was written by Jean Cayrol, a survivor of Mauthausen; however, it too would not use specific survivor testimony. The purpose of the documentary, other than to memorialize, was largely a <q>lest we forget</q> statement. Resnais&#146s art-film <cite>Night and Fog</cite>, is as much a documentary as it is a political statement.<sup><a href="#fn52" id="ref52">52</a></sup> The thirty minute documentary uses film reels, still images, and panning shots of the dilapidated ruins of the camps. Resnais refused to work on the film without the help of someone who had survived the Holocaust. Jean Cayrol, a survivor of Mauthausen, wrote the bulk of the narration.<sup><a href="#fn53" id="ref53">53</a></sup> Despite Cayrol&#146s involvement, no effort is made to give the particularities of individual experience.</p>

		<p>Despite this, <cite>Night and Fog</cite> has received overwhelmingly positive reviews. For example, in a 1988, Dr. David O. Friedrichs of the University of Scranton, gives the film a glowing review, calling it <q>one of the greatest documentaries ever made.</q><sup><a href="#fn54" id="ref54">54</a></sup> The professor of sociology states that he has been using the film in his classroom for years for its length and visceral impact. When he speaks of visceral impact, he must speak of the images of the camps &mdash; the grotesque piles of the dead, starved inmates being given food just after liberation, and images of naked women who were shot and buried in mass graves.</p>

		<p>The few images of women are exactly those images listed for visceral impact: women who were forced to undress before being shot or gassed, and the corpses of women being thrown into trucks or bulldozed into mass graves. The only reels of women who are not dead or soon to die are <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> women. Indeed, visually, it seems that women are only used for their impact. The viewer is easily transformed into a voyeur &mdash; these women are sensational, used for their horrifying visceral appeal. This use of sensational images while ignoring individual experience, coupled with a universalist narrative in which there is no distinction that the victims were specifically Jewish, further makes this film less about the Holocaust and more an emotional appeal.</p>

		<p>While one would not expect many personal experiences to be given in such a broad documentary, at no point is <q>sex for food</q> or rape, abortion or sterilization (of women or men), childbirth or the fate of children addressed. These common things which women experienced within the camps are categorized as accessory to the general experience (men&#146s experience) and therefore are excluded. Not only is the suffering of women and women&#146s bodies used for a visceral appeal, it is done so without giving women any voice at all.<sup><a href="#fn55" id="ref55">55</a></sup></p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="worldatwar">Jeremy Issacs: <cite>The World At War</cite></h3>

		<p>For the average American and English audience, it would not be until the 1970s that a depiction of camp conditions would be televised on daytime television. Perhaps one of the first documentaries to do so was the series <cite>The World At War</cite> (1972-1973), created by Jeremy Issacs and produced by Thames, which would be televised on ITV in Britain and <abbr title="Public Broadcasting Service" class="abbr">PBS</abbr> in America. Every episode of <cite>The World At War</cite> used testimonies by veterans, civilians, and/or survivors. On March 24, 1973, the twentieth episode, <q>Genocide: 1941-1945</q> was aired. This episode of the twenty-six episode series was one of the first popular war documentaries to address the Holocaust and to do so by consulting victims. It is also the first I have seen that uses women&#146s&#146 testimonies.</p>

		<p>Rather than one writer, or two producers working on <cite>The World At War</cite>, a group of producers, writers, and researchers were assigned to the series. The producers took turns, each of them working on several episodes. The particular episode of <q>Genocide: 1942-1945</q> was written by Charles Bloomberg, with research from Drora Kass and Susan McConachy. It was directed by Michael Darlow, whom also directed <q>Occupation: Holland &mdash; 1940-1944</q> and two later episodes in a small series called <cite>The Final Solution</cite>, which was an expanded version of the episode <q>Genocide</q>, using all the elements not used in the original episode, such as most of the problematic interview with Karl Wolff.<sup><a href="#fn56" id="ref56">56</a></sup></p>

		<p>James Chapman, who wrote the article <q>Television and History: <cite>The World At War</cite>,</q> frequently uses memos and correspondence between the members of the production team to show that pains were taken in the name of authenticity. He gives us this statement from Jeremy Issacs:</p>

			<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The big screen viewings we held last week, and subsequent detailed scrutiny of one programme, have revealed too many mistakes in the use of library film. I know all the difficulties, but it is important to remember that we are not making &lsquo;poetic&#146 films with license to use footage where we please. We are making an historic series and should not knowingly use pictures purporting to be what they are not. We must tighten up.<sup><a href="#fn57" id="ref57">57</a></sup></p></blockquote>

		<p>This fixation on visual historical accuracy is mirrored in the use of survivor testimony, which never supersedes the narrator but instead supplements the narrative of the episode. Chapman cites Arthur Marwick as observing, that the documentary series does have a narrative in mind: <q>[t]he general theme was that all war is dreadful</q> and that the series followed a formula in which they first formed an interpretation, then used eye-witnesses to illustrate their point.<sup><a href="#fn58" id="ref58">58</a></sup></p>

		<p>Chapman comments that <q><cite>The World At War</cite> pioneered the use of oral history long before it became fashionable among historians.</q><sup><a href="#fn59" id="ref59">59</a></sup> Indeed, this is the earliest documentary I have seen to use interviews, especially interviews with people who were not considered <q>essential</q> to the war. In the episode, <q>Genocide: 1942-1945,</q> six survivors give their accounts: Rita Boas Koupman, Avraham Kochavi, Rivka Yosilevska, Don Paisikowic, Rudolf Vrba, and Primo Levi. Accompanying their testimonies are interviews with Winston Churchill&#146s foreign secretary, Lord Avon, and interviews with three former <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> men, Karl Wolff, Richard B&#246;ch, and Wilhelm H&#246;ttl. Overwhelmingly, the interviews are with men. Of the survivors, Avraham Kochavi&#146s testimonies are given a particular preference, and he is returned to at least three times throughout the film.</p>

		<p>Rita Boas Koupman, a survivor from the Netherlands, has an incredibly short interview. She comments that once they opened the door to the cattle car, <q>I was afraid then, for the first time, and you know why? There were flames until the sky and a strange smell. The smell I remember from home when my mother burns on Friday a chicken.</q><sup><a href="#fn60" id="ref60">60</a></sup> While she is not given much time at all, this small snippet is perhaps one of the most vivid detail of the entire documentary.<sup><a href="#fn61" id="ref61">61</a></sup></p>

		<p>Rivka Yosilevska receives the longer screen-time of the women. Yosilevska, with a weary expression, gives her testimony in a near monotone. She painfully tells the interviewer, <q>he told me to put her [daughter] down. I wanted to, but she wouldn&#146t let me. She hid her head so as not to see what was being done with her. He forcibly, as far as I can remember, took her, stood her up. He shot, or didn&#146t shoot. I neither saw nor heard.</q><sup><a href="#fn62" id="ref62">62</a></sup>The inclusion of this interview is crucially important because it gives the viewer some idea of women&#146s struggles &mdash; as the designated caretakers of children, they often were faced with the terrible choice of dying with their children, or having their children put to death.</p>

		<p>Male survivors also speak of women within the documentary. The narrator comments that the old, sick, the lame, pregnant mothers, women with children were to be murdered upon arrival. Rudolf Vrba expands upon this, telling of women who, upon being told by one guard that her children and herself would be killed, they would appeal to the next officer who would reassure them, <q>madame, do you think we are barbarians?</q><sup><a href="#fn63" id="ref63">63</a></sup> Vrba continues to tell of women being taking to the gas chambers who were calm in the lorries until the engines were started. He says that they would jump from the trucks only to be killed by <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> men. He says that a rabbi who saw this denounced God. Rudolf Vrba&#146s testimony does not necessarily illuminate women&#146s lives, but the response of men to their deaths.</p>

		<p>Much more time is allotted to the interviews with men, perhaps twice the amount of time women receive. To some degree, the less screen-time devoted to women&#146s interviews can be attributed to the favoring of men&#146s narratives. However, it is also quite likely that the earliest filmmakers were not even aware that women&#146s experiences were any different than men&#146s, given that most filmmakers were not historians, and the most popular survivor stories were written by men. Very few women&#146s stories were translated into English at the time this documentary was filmed.  It seems strange that women like Rita Boas Koupman would only give one statement when her interview probably lasted much longer; however in the scope of popular conceptions of the Holocaust, the statements excluded were likely those deemed less important or had already been said in some variation by a man. Topically, <q>Genocide</q> gives a very general picture with some specifics about the Holocaust; it was not created with the attempt of educating the populace with the particularities of the Holocaust, and indeed it is extremely uncommon in this period of film that such a series which typically would focus on the <q>strict facts</q> or military history should include such issues as the home front and the Holocaust with such subjective methods as oral testimony.</p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="genocide">Arnold Schwartzmann: <cite>Genocide</cite></h3>

		<p>Nearly ten years later, Arnold Schwartzman released <cite>Genocide</cite> (1982), featuring Orson Welles and Elizabeth Taylor as narrators, which would use the very same narrative of Rivka Yosilevska used in <cite>The World At War&#146s</cite> <q>Genocide.</q> Most of the interviews are read by Elizabeth Taylor, while Orson Welles narrated the statements made by Nazi party members and gave the vast majority of the historical narrative. Arnold Schwartzman&#146s <cite>Genocide</cite>, produced with the aid of the Simon Wiesenthal Center at Yeshiva University of Los Angeles, won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1982. Arnold Schwartzman, originally a graphic designer, is well known for his work designing elements of the Oscar commemorative posters, trailers, and billboards, as well as his permanent exhibit in the Museum of Tolerance.<sup><a href="#fn64" id="ref64">64</a></sup> Given this background, his documentary is much more focused on presentation than many others. The documentary relies on the star power of its narrators, Orson Welles and Elizabeth Taylor. Stylistically, it combines reels and collaged stills in a way not dissimilar to Soviet art-films, and all survivor testimonies are dramatically read by Elizabeth Taylor, rather than breaking stylistic continuity with reels.</p>

		<p><cite>Genocide</cite> begins with a description of European Jewry, giving the viewer some vibrant impression of Jewish culture throughout history and the roots of antisemitism. This and Lanzmann&#146s <cite>Shoah</cite> are the only documentaries to really address the history of anti-Jewish sentiment. Most of what is given about women is by Leon Kahn, who recalls the mass execution of women and children, including his mother, grandmother, aunt and cousin. He tells of mass rape and of being forced to watch as his cousins were brutalized. Leon Kahn&#146s testimony is returned to multiple times throughout the documentary. Leon Kahn tells of his mother&#146s death, of how she stayed with her ailing mother, knowing exactly what would happen to them. Again, Kahn&#146s testimony is used when discussing the brutality of <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> guards against Jewish women upon their arrival at the camp.<sup><a href="#fn65" id="ref65">65</a></sup></p>

		<p>The only woman&#146s voice used in the documentary is Rivka Yosilevska, a Polish Jewish man who survived a mass killing enacted by <i lang="de">Einsatzgruppen</i>, paramilitary extermination squads responsible for the mass killings in Eastern Europe . One gets the sensation that her testimony is used mainly because it is iconic, as it was used in the Eichmann Trial. In her trademark, quavering voice, Elizabeth Taylor dramatically reads how she was made to strip, the tearing of children from their mothers and the murder of her child right before her eyes.<sup><a href="#fn66" id="ref66">66</a></sup> Majority of Genocide&#146s selected parts of Rivka Yosilevska address what it was like surviving being buried in a mass grave, which is strange given that only a fraction of Rivka Yosilevska&#146s interview focuses on this. This emphasis on being buried alive is an emotional appeal to the audience &mdash; how terrible, to be buried alive &mdash; when it could have been the much more meaningful mother mourning the murder of her child, such as we see in The World At War&#146s <q>Genocide.</q> When comparing <q>Genocide</q> and <cite>Genocide</cite>, it seems that the former more accurately expresses the trauma of a mother who has lost her family and children, while the latter is purely sensational.</p>

		<p>The narrator does address the experiments of artificial insemination and the removal of breasts (however does not even mention forced sterilization or abortion), but only as acts toward women. This exclusion of men from medical experimentation very pointedly sensationalizes medical violence specifically against women.  Yet most of the images are, perplexingly, not of women at all, but of men being subjected to hypothermic conditions. The selective use of Leon Kahn&#146s testimony, where women are only the victims of sexual and physical violence, and Rivka Yosilevska&#146s horrifying testimony of being buried alive also further give the impression of sensationalizing and selling women&#146s suffering, rather than looking at how that suffering affected women.</p>

		<p>This film is as much a piece of art memorializing the victims of the Holocaust as it is educational. The scope of the film, covering the roots of antisemitism, the conditions of the camps and ghettos, and the mass killings of the East give this short film has the great capacity to educate masses of people, especially given the appealing voices of Orson Welles and Elizabeth Taylor. While the testimony given by Leon Kahn is a powerful representation of violence against women, they would have been much more powerful coming from women. Instead, the testimonies seem to be used in a similar way to Resnais&#146s <cite>Night and Fog</cite>, for visceral appeal with negligible representation.</p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="shoah">Claude Lanzmann: <cite>Shoah</cite></h3>

		<p>It is with Claude Lanzmann&#146s <cite>Shoah</cite> (1985), we see the shift from telling general facts and giving audiences the events of the Holocaust to a very specific focus on survivor experience. Lanzmann filmed <q>350 hours of footage</q><sup><a href="#fn67" id="ref67">67</a></sup>, however women&#146s individual experiences are largely absent from the film. Perhaps the most popular and successful of the films reviewed here is Claude Lanzmann&#146s <cite>Shoah</cite>. Massively popular in the United States, especially within the Jewish community, Stuart Liebman notes that for years the film was <q>the most profitable documentary film ever released in the United States,</q><sup><a href="#fn68" id="ref68">68</a></sup> <cite>Shoah</cite>, nine and a half hours long, rejects the rigorous ideology that has driven such series as The World At War. In his preface to the text of the film, Simone de Beauvoir comments that it is a <q>poetical construction.</q><sup><a href="#fn69" id="ref69">69</a></sup> It lacks chronology and each individual interviewed is interviewed as an individual &mdash; there is no narration to interpret their experiences. In an interview, Lanzmann stated that he had done this <q>so that the people continue to work at it &mdash; during the screening, but also afterward.</q><sup><a href="#fn70" id="ref70">70</a></sup></p>

		<p>Unlike the other films, <cite>Shoah</cite> does not use archival footage. In an interview, Lanzmann addresses his opposition to the use of these reels. He points out that no substantial visual, documentary material exists of the process of extermination. Most importantly, he comments that <q>the structure of the film must determine its own intelligibility.</q><sup><a href="#fn71" id="ref71">71</a></sup> Here, Lanzmann means that common, institutionalized knowledge must not take precedence over the evocative testimonies and gestures of survivors. This focus on survivor testimony and the reenactment of events &mdash; having Abraham Bomba, a barber who once cut women&#146s hair at Auschwitz, give testimony while cutting hair, for example &mdash; and refusing to speak of the Holocaust as simply an event in the past, Lanzmann is asserting that the Holocaust is still being felt. This is how Lanzmann approaches the impossible task of representing the unrepresentable events of the Holocaust.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, it is almost exclusively men who are asked to recount their suffering. The only Jewish woman to give a lengthy testimony is Inge Deutschkron, who was not a concentration camp survivor, but rather survived by remaining hidden in Berlin and later immigrated to Israel after the war. Her interview, which takes place in Berlin, forces her to remember and relive the terrible exclusion and indifference of her German neighbors.<sup><a href="#fn72" id="ref72">72</a></sup> In their article <q>Gendered Translations: Claude Lanzmann&#146s <cite>Shoah</cite>,</q> Marianne Hirsch and Leo Spitzer point out that <q>[u]nlike most of the male witnesses whose faces fill the screen for long periods of time, Inge Deutschkron is little more than a disembodied voice: her narrative is largely presented in voice-over as scenes of Berlin and departing trains occupy the spaces of the screen; her face and name appear only at the very end of her brief account.</q><sup><a href="#fn73" id="ref73">73</a></sup></p>

		<p>Also notable is that most of the women within the film receive no subtitle giving a name for them, or that their whole name is not given. Despite the fact that Jewish women are the focus of this paper, it is relevant to point out that a perpetrator, Martha Michelsohn, the wife of a Nazi schoolteacher in Chelmno, is simply given the name <q>Mrs. Michelsohn;</q> her importance is dictated by the fact that she was close to a perpetrator, Mr. Michelsohn, despite the fact that most of her testimony used in <cite>Shoah</cite> never actually includes her husband. Yet we are given Mrs. Michelsohn as an example of passive antisemitism.<sup><a href="#fn74" id="ref74">74</a></sup> It is worth noting that women perpetrators are rarely interviewed, as women were assumed to be incapable of being perpetrators except in very singular cases. The prevailing public assumption is that only <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> men and male state administrators are culpable in genocide. More recent scholarship, such as that of Wendy Lower, argues that women, in roles ranging from typist to camp guard, share the blame.<sup><a href="#fn75" id="ref75">75</a></sup> This lack of culpability does extend to Jewish women in camps.</p>

		<p>Mrs. Michelsohn is not the only woman to receive this treatment. Toward the end of the film we are given a testimony by two women, but are only given the information <q>Gertrude Schneider and her mother (New York), survivors of the ghetto.</q><sup><a href="#fn76" id="ref76">76</a></sup> No context is given to the two of them, the ghetto they survived is never named and neither is Gertrude Schneider&#146s weeping mother. It is interesting that a tiny segment with unlabeled women, which was likely part of a larger interview, would be chosen when Jewish men are given lengthier scenes of silence.</p>

		<p>Particularly interesting is the fact that many of the women who are only briefly featured in <cite>Shoah</cite> give lengthy, unused testimonies that can be easily found on the United States Holocaust Memorial website. Paula Biren&#146s interview is a little over two hours long, discussing the violence Jewish people faced in Poland by antisemitic Poles, noting that that they aided Germans in identifying Jewish neighbors. She also gives a vivid description of life within the ghetto and the mass deportation of children.<sup><a href="#fn77" id="ref77">77</a></sup> Similarly, Ruth Elias, whose interview is nearly two and a half hours long, tells of her pregnancy in Theresienstadt, being sent to Ravensbrueck, and then finally being sent to Auschwitz. Here, Dr. Mengele experimented on her baby, and after some time he intended to gas them both. It was only after choosing to kill her own child that she was sent to a forced labor camp, where she formed lasting bonds with many of the women there.<sup><a href="#fn78" id="ref78">78</a></sup> The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&#146s online film archive, there are two survivor testimonies by women Lanzmann filmed that were completely absent from the final cut of <cite>Shoah</cite> &mdash; the three and a half hour interview with Hanna Marton, a survivor of Bergen-Belsen, and a two and a half hour long interview with Ada Lichtman, a survivor of Sobibor.</p>

		<p>The fact that Ada Lichtman&#146s interview is absent from the final film is strange, given that during the recording, she is sewing doll clothes while she tells of Franz Stangl (the commandant of Sobibor and Treblinka) and cleaning the toys taken from children&#146s transports.<sup><a href="#fn79" id="ref79">79</a></sup> The performative aspect of Ada Lichtman&#146s testimony would easily have meshed quite well with the reenactment seen throughout the film, and indeed the reenactment implies that he thought to use the footage. It is safe to say, that one can agree with Hirsch and Spitzer&#146s statement that Lanzmann <q>clearly privileges testimonies from men,</q> given the very few women included in this film, the fact that the Jewish women who do appear only do so once, and the hours of unused footage of interviews with Jewish women.<sup><a href="#fn80" id="ref80">80</a></sup></p>

		<p>Women&#146s testimony would have benefited Lanzmann&#146s <cite>Shoah</cite> enormously, especially as he sought to disrupt common, institutionalized knowledge of the Holocaust. His assertion that the Holocaust is still being felt is perhaps most evident in the grieving of mothers, forced to <q>chose</q> the death of their child so that they might live, or the woman made infertile by Nazi experimentation who then questions her identity as a woman. It is strange given that his focus on particularities would have been greatly emphasized by a focus on gendered particularities; he sought to break down conceptions about the Holocaust, and to force the viewer to digest what the Holocaust meant to different parties. Perhaps Lanzmann saw pregnancy, sex, and abortion as not particularly important in the wider scope of the injustice of the Holocaust. It is also quite possible that Lanzmann would omit sexual violence out of respect for the women interviewed.</p>

		<p>Rarely do Jewish women, or the representatives of these women, speak of the effect of starvation and sickness on their bodies &mdash; notably, the loss of menses—and rarely do they address infertility caused by experimentation or the experience of childbirth or abortion. This is something missing in most, if not all, documentaries. However, menstruation and bodily functions are not absent from written narratives, for women regularly address these topics with some regularity. For example, Isabella Leitner, a Hungarian Jewish woman, explicitly states that in the cattle cars headed towards Auschwitz, <q>I am menstruating. There is no way for me to change my napkin.</q><sup><a href="#fn81" id="ref81">81</a></sup> Due to the shame many women have towards their bodily functions, or the fact that many interviewers are men, perhaps these interviewed women felt pressured not to discuss their bodies. Alternately, if women did express these experiences, Lanzmann&#146s exclusion of those topics avoids discussing a taboo topic which likely would have been met by backlash.</p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="onesurvivor">Kary Antholis: <cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite></h3>

		<p>In the late 1980s and the 1990s, documentaries become ever more specific. Holocaust documentaries that focus on individual families or small groups of individuals both during the Holocaust and after, as well as the documentaries giving a broad general picture are made &mdash; typically using a combination archival footage and survivor testimonies to give a more complete or more authentic picture. Due to the growing popularity of women&#146s narratives in mainstream media and the translation of many of their narratives into English, women became more commonly consulted. The emotionally moving <cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite> (1995) by Kary Antholis, for example, is the forty-minute testimony of Gerda Weissmann Klein supplemented mainly by photographs.</p>

		<p><cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite> by Kary Antholis is one a particularly important documentary. Kary Antholis&#146s documentary short film is an adaptation of Gerda Weissmann Klein&#146s autobiographical text, <cite>All But My Life</cite>, written in 1957. This documentary film is exclusively testimony by Gerda Weissmann Klein, either focusing directly on her or giving us her narration of the events along with stills and reels. It was awarded an Academy Award for Documentary Short Subject and a Prime-time Emmy for Outstanding Informational Special. Produced by the <abbr title="United States Holocaust Memorial Museum">USHMM</abbr>, <cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite> is now offered by the Southern Poverty Law Center in their Teaching Tolerance program so that high school teachers may show the film to their students.</p>

		<p><cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite> presents a unique circumstance. This is one of the few instances where one may compare the written testimony of a woman survivor to her oral testimony. Of course, Gerda Weissmann Klein&#146s written testimony is more complete as the act of writing a narrative takes premeditation. However, she focuses on many of the same things in her interview as in her autobiography. She discusses the loss of her brother, Arthur, and the effect it had on her mother, father, and herself.</p>

		<p>In her oral testimony she talks much less about her depression. Throughout her autobiography, she says that she <q>fell into a state of apathy</q> and that <q>I could not read, slept little, and cried a lot.</q><sup><a href="#fn82" id="ref82">82</a></sup> Also, prior to reading her autobiography, the viewer is given no context to her past friendships. She mentions in the interview that her close friend, Ilse, dies in her arms during their death march—we assume Ilse is a friend she has made when working in the camps. However, in her autobiography, she indicates that she knew Ilse before being deported from Bielitz.<sup><a href="#fn83" id="ref83">83</a></sup> This lapse in explanation is likely because Ilse was one of her best friends, and without prompting she might assume the audience was aware of that fact.</p>

		<p>Also absent from the used oral testimony is the forward and uncomfortable, sexual romantic advances of the thirty year old Abek Feigenblatt. It seems particularly strange, given that Gerda says that he <q>fell into the role of older brother.</q><sup><a href="#fn84" id="ref84">84</a></sup> Not only did he serve an important emotional role as a brother, he attempted to force himself upon her and tried to force her to marry him.<sup><a href="#fn85" id="ref85">85</a></sup> Perhaps this is why his presence is omitted &mdash; he is a painful memory, not easily recalled in the format of an interview. Alternately, it was edited from the interview, as most of her life before living in the camps is immediately pertinent to the general narrative of the documentary. However, it is a shame that this part of her testimony is not included &mdash; of the documentaries reviewed, there are practically no women who discuss rape, sexual assault, or predatory relationships, despite the fact that all of these things happened with some frequency.</p>

		<p>Because the film focuses on Gerda Weissmann Klein, this allows for her to express her innermost feelings. Rarely are thoughts of suicide expressed by individuals in documentaries, for example. Many times survivors will cite that others threw themselves into the electric fences of the perimeter of the camp, however they are never commenting that they considered suicide themselves. Mrs. Weissmann Klein very pointedly talks about at least two times when she considered suicide: once, before deportation, and again after some time of living in a labor camp.<sup><a href="#fn86" id="ref86">86</a></sup> There is a fair chance that other survivors interviewed in other documentaries expressed similarly and that it was unused. Suicide and suicidal thoughts, along with all issues of mental health, are under scrutiny by the public. Suicidal thoughts and actions tend to be read as a character flaw, and many documentaries make survivors out to be heroes or completely blameless, when in reality many were able to survive by disadvantaging, and even killing, their peers.</p>

		<p>The focus on Klein&#146s inner-life also allows for her to discuss relationships with her friends. Throughout her entire interview, she references her friendship with Suse Kunz and Ilse, whom she remained friends with until the very end. Suse and Gerda had made a bet as they were being deported that the war would be over within six months where the winner was to receive a quart of strawberries and cream.<sup><a href="#fn87" id="ref87">87</a></sup> Tearfully, Gerda tells us that Suse never got her strawberries because she died just hours before her liberation.<sup><a href="#fn88" id="ref88">88</a></sup> This friendship stands apart from many men&#146s narratives. Goldenberg comments that, <q>[w]hile it may be reasonable to assume that such bonding was not exclusive to women, it is difficult to find consistent evidence of men caring about one another to the extent that women did.</q><sup><a href="#fn89" id="ref89">89</a></sup> She continues to say that <q>[b]onding between men was more a factor of political proclivities than of the ethic of caring.</q><sup><a href="#fn90" id="ref90">90</a></sup> It is these ethical, caring friendships that help women like Gerda Weissmann Klein to stay alive, both in a literal physical sense and in a spiritual and emotional sense.</p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="warning">Lawrence Rees: <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite></h3>

		<p>Alongside documentaries like <cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite>, we also have those like Laurence Rees&#146s series <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> (1997), a very popular general documentary covering the span of the Reich; this documentary resembles <cite>The World At War</cite> in this respect. At least three episodes address the Holocaust, and every episode addresses antisemitism. Laurence Rees&#146s <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> was mainly chosen for its considerable popularity. In 2000, the British Film Institute awarded it 93rd in a list of 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. It won two BAFTAs in Best Factual Series and Best Editing, and won the 1998 Peabody Award. Laurence Rees himself was once the head of <abbr title="British Broadcasting Network" class="abbr">BBC</abbr> TV History programmes. He is widely published and earned the History Book of the Year Award at the British Book Awards in 2006 for his <cite>Auschwitz: The Nazis and the Final Solution</cite> (the accompanying text to <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite>). Rees attended Oxford University and received an honorary doctorate from University of Sheffield in 2005 and an honorary doctorate from Open University in 2011. In his biography, Rees comments that both this documentary and the later <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite> has been <q>enormously successful, not just in Britain where it transmitted to universal acclaim and audience of over 4 million. The series has been subsequently transmitted in France, Spain, Poland, Germany, America and many other countries.</q><sup><a href="#fn91" id="ref91">91</a></sup></p>

		<p>This series, much like his later <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite>, is divided into six episodes. The first is <q>Helped to Power,</q> which covers Hitler&#146s rise to power and interviews Social Democrats, Communists, and Nazis. <q>Chaos and Consent</q> covers the implementation of radical racial policies and the formation of euthanasia programs, <i lang="de">Kristallnacht</i> and the early concentration camp, Dachau. The third episode, <q>The Wrong War,</q> covers the alliance between Great Britain and the Soviet Union. The fourth episode, <q>The Wild East</q> covers ethnic cleansing, the resettlement of ethnic Germans, and the expulsion of Poles from occupied Poland. <q>The Road to Treblinka</q> covers mass killings after the invasion of the Soviets, spending most of the hour on the topic of mass shoots in the East. The final episode of the series is <q>Fighting to the End</q> which is a collection of interviews with German soldiers and civilians, asking the question of why the Germans fought when military defeat was imminent.</p>

			<h4 class="subsubsub" id="chaos"><cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> - <q>Chaos and Consent</q></h4>

				<p>Only three episodes of the six in this series really discuss the Holocaust, although antisemitism is at addressed in every episode. The first episode to interview a Jewish survivor is <q>Chaos and Consent</q> which gives an overview of Nazi racial policies, <i lang="de">Kristallnacht</i>, and how the Gestapo operated. The only Jewish victim interviewed is Rudi Bamber, a Jewish refugee from Nuremberg whose father had been beaten to death during Kristallnacht.<sup><a href="#fn92" id="ref92">92</a></sup> His testimony wholly focuses on antisemitism and German policy before ghettos were even established.</p>

			<h4 class="subsubsub" id="wildwest"><cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> - <q>The Wild West</q></h4>

				<p>The next episode to deal with these topics is <q>The Wild West</q> which discusses ethnic cleansing in Poland and Germanisation. Despite giving an overview of ethnic cleansing in Poland, there is only a little mention of the ghettos or the participation of Poles in the destruction of Polish Jewish communities, and no mention at all of the seizure of Jewish property which was given to ethnic Germans. This is particularly strange given that the reels used in this episode include ethnic Germans cleaning out the belongings of Polish Jewish people removed from their homes.</p>

				<p>Only one Jewish person, Estra Frenkiel, who was imprisoned in &#x141;&#243;d&#378; Ghetto from 1940-1944, is interviewed but the bulk of her testimony consists of very general information. At some point, when asked about food in the ghetto, she says that her husband was surprised that she was eating so little. Her response, <q>I said, &lsquo;I don&#146t need more,&#146</q> does hint at feelings of obligation that are expressed in many women&#146s narratives, where they forgo food for their families.<sup><a href="#fn93" id="ref93">93</a></sup> However, we are not given context to her statement. Any questions regarding her family that must have existed in her interview were not put into the documentary. Furthermore, very little context is given concerning the conditions of &#x141;&#243;d&#378; ghetto, which was the second largest ghetto established in Nazi-occupied Poland; starvation and disease were rampant, and sanitation was exceedingly poor.<sup><a href="#fn94" id="ref94">94</a></sup></p>

				<p>However, Estra Frenkiel does address rape, a neglected topic in public documentaries. Frenkiel&#146s statements dispel the myth that the Germans would not commit acts of illegal race defilement. The narrator introduces Hans Biebow, the chief of Nazi administration in &#x141;&#243;d&#378; Ghetto, bringing up his history of sexual violence. Estra Frenkiel testifies about the attempted rape of a friend:</p>

					<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>She was serving him coffee, and when he saw the pretty girl he touched her up. In all her life, the girl had not seen a German man. She had seen Germans from afar but not this close, and she didn&#146t want it. She was still a young girl, and she resisted. So he tore off her dress. It is highly likely that nothing happened because she ran away, so he shot at her and hit her. She bled profusely. She went back to her room and lay down there. It was terrible.<sup><a href="#fn95" id="ref95">95</a></sup></blockquote></p>

			<h4 class="subsubsub" id="treblinka"><cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> - <q>The Road to Treblinka</q></h4>

				<p>The final episode to address the Holocaust is <q>The Road to Treblinka,</q> which is an account of mass killings in Nazi occupied territories, specifically after the invasion of the Soviet Union. Most of those interviewed are bystanders and perpetrators who were acquitted after the war. A fair number of survivors are interviewed, however of these is only one woman, Riva Losanskaya. In her testimony, she tells of asking another Jewish woman why she would not try to escape with her. Losanskaya says, <q>[s]he replied, &#146what about my child?&#146</q><sup><a href="#fn96" id="ref96">96</a></sup> Riva Losanskaya and her mother were able to escape, but the others, including the woman and her child, were ordered to undress and were killed by Lithuanian volunteers. The narrator goes on to say that at the Butrimonys Massacre, the <i lang="de">Einsatzgruppen</i> recorded that sixty-seven Jewish men, while three hundred and seventy Jewish women and three hundred and three children were killed. While not explicitly stating so, this segment shows the turning point in military practice (usually only men were shot), while Riva Losanskaya&#146s testimony helps to explain why more women did not escape.</p>

			<h4 class="subsubsub" id="warning_summary"><cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> - Summary</h4>

				<p>The vast majority of Rees&#146s <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite>, does disproportionately favor the voices of male survivors. Women rarely give testimonies for the conditions of the ghettos, concentration camps, or death camps. Women are not consulted in the every day, and one gets the feeling that their presence is to mark the uncommon rather than the regular. We see the same in Rees&#146s other documentary, <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite>, as well. However, it is understandable that in Rees&#146s <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite> and </cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite>, that there is less emphasis on survivor testimony in general. While discussing antisemitism and the Holocaust, Rees is more concerned with educating the public on how the Nazis came to power and Nazi state policy, and is more concerned with generality rather than how Nazi state policy actually effected the lives of Jewish individuals &mdash; and in particular, women.</p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="lastdays">James Moll: <cite>The Last Days</cite></h3>

		<p>James Moll&#146s <cite>The Last Days</cite> (1998), is an interview of five Hungarian Jewish survivors &mdash; three women and two men &mdash; which uses all of their accounts equally in telling the narrative of the Holocaust while giving their particular experiences, showing that women were becoming a visible category of survivor. Moll&#146s Oscar-nominated <cite>The Last Days</cite>, tells the story of the lives of five Hungarian Jewish people: Bill Basch, Irene Zisblatt, Renee Firestone, Alice Lok Chana, and Tom Lantos. It follows their lives, blending together their testimonies to form a narrative, from occupation, being forced into ghettos, being deported, and finally arriving at their respective camps. A reviewer in the <cite>New York Times</cite> comments that <q>[i]f the broad outlines of its story are similar to Claude Lanzmann&#146s nine-hour epic documentary, <q>Shoah,</q> its brisk pace and compact form make it the opposite in some ways of Mr. Lanzmann&#146s exhaustive 1985 masterpiece.</q><sup><a href="#fn97" id="ref97">97</a></sup> Michael Wilmington at the <cite>Chicago Tribune</cite> called it an <q>essential film</q> and that it <q>tends to put things back in perspective.</q><sup><a href="#fn98" id="ref98">98</a></sup></p>

		<p>It is worth noting that three of the five survivors interviewed are women, and that their interviews are done specifically for the film, rather than pulled from archives. Each survivor contributes to the overall narrative. Each survivor describes the squalor of the ghettos, the inhumane journey from ghettos to camps, and the conditions of the camps. In a move that is relatively uncommon, women survivors are not brought in to give an accessory account but rather contribute to the whole.</p>

		<p>This more female-oriented documentary gives the viewer very female-specific experiences. Renee Firestone tells of when she arrived at Auschwitz. Before deportation, she had chosen to put on a swimsuit her father had given her. She recalls the sentimental value of the bathing suit when she is told to remove her clothing:</p>

			<blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I had this feeling that if I take this bathing suit off, if I leave this bathing suit behind, all the wonderful memories that were built in this bathing suit.... I kept remembering how I wore it at the swimming pool and how the boys were whistling and my friends were so jealous and now I&#146m going to take it off and I&#146m going to leave it here. Everything that meant everything in life to me, I&#146m going to leave behind.</q><sup><a href="#fn99" id="ref99">99</a></sup></p></blockquote>

		<p>Renee Firestone&#146s testimony gives us the rare glimpse of an individual woman&#146s thoughts about something dehumanizing. Being forced to remove her bathing suit was a destruction of not just her past, but her feminine identity, and it is this destruction of her identity which is dehumanizing. This perceptive, nuanced statement would have gone unspoken, were Renee Firestone&#146s testimony replaced with anyone else.</p>

		<p>Not only does the documentary use an abundance of female voices, it also pointedly fixates on women&#146s issues. Hans M&#252;nch, a former <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> physician in Auschwitz and the sole person acquitted in the 1947 Auschwitz trials, informs the audience that many experiments were done in Auschwitz <q>to find ways to sterilize women, specifically Jewish women in order to diminish the race.</q><sup><a href="#fn100" id="ref100">100</a></sup> This is the first and only documentary I have seen that explicitly states that Jewish women were specifically targeted by a form of sexual medical violence. In actuality, both men and women were targeted by sexual medical violence. However, it is important that sterilization was referred to as an integral part of the camp experience &mdash; most documentaries neglect to speak about sterilization all together.</p>

		<p>Also notable is that, for a documentary that also is not women-specific (meaning it does not profess to deal with women&#146s&#146 experiences or an individual woman&#146s experiences, rather a general experience of Hungarian Jewish people in the last days of the Final Solution), it also lingers on the role of mothers &mdash; as protectors and providers of their children. The narrative structure of Moll&#146s documentary, the predominantly-women survivors, lends itself to a more equal distribution of individual experiences. This asserts women&#146s history was part of and simultaneous &mdash; rather than accessory &mdash; to men&#146s&#146 experiences. By allowing women to speak for themselves, the viewer is given a more nuanced understanding of Nazi racial policy and the distinctive ways in which women were targeted (as mothers) in extermination. The inclusion of these women&#146s distinct experiences shows that filmmakers and historians were beginning to form a more nuanced understanding of the Holocaust.</p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="nazistate">Lawrence Rees: <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite></h3>

		<p>In 2005, Laurence Rees&#146 released another series, <cite>Auschwitz: The Nazis and the &lsquo;Final Solution&#146</cite> (renamed <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite> for American audiences). Its American title is more accurate, given that the documentary rarely concerns itself with the inmates of Auschwitz, rather it focuses on how Auschwitz was constructed and the activities by <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> men. However, there is a segment on Auschwitz&#146s &lsquo;Canada&#146 which mostly includes testimonies by women.</p>

		<p>Laurence Rees <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite> was chosen because it has been widely shown on television networks such as the History Channel, <abbr title="British Broadcasting Network" class="abbr">BBC</abbr>, <abbr title="British Broadcasting Network One" class="abbr">BBC One</abbr>, and <abbr title="Public Broadcasting Service" class="abbr">PBS</abbr>. It is currently offered for streaming on Netflix. It relies on color and monochrome archival footage, interviews with survivors and former Nazis, re-enactments of <abbr title="Schutzstaffel">SS</abbr> activities, and reconstruction of the camp using blueprints from the Soviet archives and computer-generated effects. Exactly like Rees&#146s <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite>, the series is broken into six episodes. Episode one, <q>Surprise Beginnings,</q> covers the invasion of the Soviet Union and the first gassings of Auschwitz. <q>Orders and Initiatives</q> covers the political development of the Final Solution. <q>Factories of Death</q> focuses on deportation and the formation of the camps Treblinka and Auschwitz. <q>Corruption</q> tells of the excesses taken by <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> guards. <q>Frenzied Killing</q> covers the deportation of Hungary&#146s Jewish population and the Allies&#146 knowledge of the camps. Finally, <q>Liberation and Revenge</q> of course covers the liberation of the camps, Jewish life in countries after being liberated, and the lack of real action taken against perpetrators.</p>

			<h4 class="subsubsub" id="factories"><cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite> - <q>Factories of Death</q></h4>

				<p>The first episode to deal with the deportation of Jewish people to Auschwitz is episode three, <q>Factories of Death.</q> The style of this series is to dramatically reenact historical events following an informative voice over. Interspersed between these reenactments are testimonies. One of the first women they interview is a Polish Jewish woman from France, Annette Muller. Annette Muller says that her mother, her brother, and herself were taken to a camp. She and her brother, Michel Muller, tell of the separation of children from their mothers as they were being deported.<sup><a href="#fn101" id="ref101">101</a></sup> Annette and Michel Muller were sent to Drancy, a concentration camp for children in France. Odette Daltroff-Baticle is then interviewed. She was one of the few adult prisoners at Drancy. Rather than discussing her own experiences, Odette Daltroff-Baticle&#146s testimony is used to tell us of the conditions of the camp in relation to the children.<sup><a href="#fn102" id="ref102">102</a></sup> The narrator tells us that the Muller children were able to escape further deportation to the East because their father bribed a French official, however their mother died in Auschwitz &mdash; the most common fate of mothers.</p>

				<p>The documentary transitions into discussing the nationality of those interned at Auschwitz. The next interviewee is Wendy Davenport, who was raised by an Austrian Jewish woman, Therese Steiner. According to Wendy Davenport, Therese Steiner was refused entrance back into England after a 1940 vacation to the Channel Island.<sup><a href="#fn103" id="ref103">103</a></sup> The narrator tells us that Therese Steiner was sent to Guernsey Island and was then deported to France, where she was sent to Auschwitz.</p>

				<p>The last woman interviewed is Eugenia Samuel, a villager living in Treblinka. She testifies about the murder of children in the camp.<sup><a href="#fn104" id="ref104">104</a></sup> From here on, the survivors are interviewed in a more haphazard way, one from Auschwitz and another from Treblinka. The overwhelming majority of interviewed people are men, especially among Holocaust survivors, although this is not difficult given that only one or two has been interviewed for each camp. Otto Pressburger, a Jewish man sent to Auschwitz, testifies about being forced to exhume the bodies of Jewish people buried in shallow graves,<sup><a href="#fn105" id="ref105">105</a></sup> while Kalman Teigman is interviewed about surviving Treblinka.<sup><a href="#fn106" id="ref106">106</a></sup></p>

				<p>This episode, and the others in the series, focus more on the operations of the Nazi state and the organization of deportations, rather than the particularities of Jewish experience before and during these deportations. Only one Jewish woman is interviewed, but due to her age and her circumstances, she gives a very limited account.</p>

			<h4 class="subsubsub" id="corruption"><cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite> - <q>Corruption</q></h4>

				<p>The episode <q>Corruption,</q> has interviews with those who worked in Auschwitz&#146s &lsquo;Canada&#146 &mdash; a group of survivors that are almost exclusively women. Helena Citronova, one of these &lsquo;Canada&#146 women, gives the startling account of how she eventually came to love one of the <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> men guarding her, Franz Wunsch. It was this relationship that saved her sister, who was to be gassed upon arrival because she came with two children.<sup><a href="#fn107" id="ref107">107</a></sup> This relationship is framed as fully consensual and is not necessarily painted as uncommon; strangely, there is no mention that non-consensual &lsquo;relationships&#146 with camp guards, purely for survival purposes, ever existed.</p>

				<p>In discussing the actions of <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> guards, the documentary addresses sexual assault of the women working in &lsquo;Canada&#146. An uncredited woman tells of the rape of a friend in &lsquo;Canada&#146 by a camp guard. Several more women are interviewed, such as Vera Alexander, a survivor of Auschwitz, who gives a small character witness of Irma Griese. Irma Griese, a woman <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> guard of various camps, notably Bergen-Belsen, was one of the accused in the Belsen Trial. She was well known for her sadism amongst prisoners and allegedly sexually tortured inmates. Interestingly, the documentary does not address the claims by inmates (such as Olga Lengyel) that Irma Griese was a sexual predator but seems to suggest such with the placement of her character witness immediately following an account of rape.<sup><a href="#fn108" id="ref108">108</a></sup> This is the second documentary to even imply that women could be perpetrators, although the documentaries make a subtle distinction that only German women were perpetrators.</p>

				<p>While the distribution of narratives is more equal, it is only within this episode. The other episodes default to male testimony. The bulk of the series is taken up with the dramatic reenactment of <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> characters and narration outlining the politics surrounding the camps, including a non-speaking role that is supposed to be Irma Grese.<sup><a href="#fn109" id="ref109">109</a></sup> Given that this is a documentary focusing on the Nazi state and the organization of Auschwitz, this is expected, especially given that the series was produced with the consultation of Professor Ian Kershaw, whose body of research focuses primarily on the organization of the Nazi state and the participation (active and passive) of Germans in the activities of the state.</p>

	<h3 class="subsub" id="ladyinnumber6">Malcolm Clarke: <cite>The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life</cite></h3>

		<p>The highly televised and Oscar-winning documentary by Malcolm Clarke <cite>The Lady in Number 6: Music Saved My Life</cite> (2013), about Alice Herz Sommer, then world&#146s oldest living Holocaust survivor, was released to a massive audience for streaming rental or instant download. This documentary focuses on the life of Alice Herz-Sommer and her relationship with her lifelong passion and pleasure: music. In this moving film, Mrs. Herz-Sommer talks at length about her relationship with her son, recalling how difficult a time the days were before deportation. She also tells of how she would defy Nazi racial laws which forbid Jewish people from playing instruments, both because of her passion and because of her son&#146s love of music. She gives a very personal story of her son Raphael listening to music. <p>He was maybe three years old, not yet, sitting the whole day. He loved &mdash; in this time it was gramophone &mdash; and suddenly it comes to an enormous fortissimo.  And the boy, he was three years old, started to cry. I asked &lsquo;why do you cry?&#146 &lsquo;The music is so beautiful.&#146</q><sup><a href="#fn110" id="ref110">110</a></sup></p>

		<p>It was perhaps this love of music which saved her son from death after they were deported to Theresienstadt, a camp where the Nazis sent Jewish intellectuals and filmed them for propaganda purposes. Her son sang in the children&#146s opera Brundibár, by Hans Krása, first performed in Theresienstadt, in 1943. It was performed for the representatives of the Red Cross to show the <q>humane</q> conditions of the camp, and again for the propaganda film <cite>The F&#252;hrer Gives the Jews a City</cite>. Immediately after filming, practically all those involved in the production of the opera &mdash; including the composer, director, the musicians and most of the children&#146s choir &mdash; were rounded up and sent to Auschwitz, where they were immediately gassed. Her son is remarkable, given that he was one of the very few known survivors from Theresienstadt, let alone child survivor.</p>

		<p>She credits her close proximity to her son with his emotional and physical well-being and comments that she was a loving mother. However, she gives no details why her son was spared. While the nature of Theresienstadt, as a transit camp and a camp used for filming of propaganda, allowed for them to exist, the camp was a death sentence for many Jewish people. Transports from the camp were sent directly to Auschwitz, Treblinka, and Majdanek. Figures from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum cite that around fifteen thousand children were sent to Theresienstadt, and of this ninety percent were sent to death camps.<sup><a href="#fn111" id="ref111">111</a></sup> One would assume that it was because her son was classically trained, however this is never addressed within the film.</p>

		<p>As for herself, Alice Herz-Sommer credits music for her survival, both spiritually and in a literal sense. She says that <q>it is a mystery, that at the first tone of the music starts, it goes straight away in our soul.</q><sup><a href="#fn112" id="ref112">112</a></sup> Music allowed prisoners an escape from the monotony of camp life. Her friend comments that with the music <q>you can go into another world</q> and that playing the cello saved her life because it prevented her from being sent immediately by train to the gas chambers.<sup><a href="#fn113" id="ref113">113</a></sup> Alice Herz-Sommer was not just allowed to exist because she was an impressive cello player, it was because prior to the war her family could afford the education and training to make her such an impressive player. In Alice Herz-Sommer&#146s case, being higher-class gave her slightly better chances at survival.</p>

		<p>Both Alice Herz-Sommer and her friends quite uncommonly express very positive outlooks that are oftentimes excluded in documentaries. Alice Herz-Sommer comments that she has found the beauty of life and her son, while her friends say that the experience taught them what matters the most in life: <q>life matters, human relationships, and that&#146s about it.</q><sup><a href="#fn114" id="ref114">114</a></sup> Another friend continues that it <q>has enriched my life, and I am grateful for that experience. I can say that.</q><sup><a href="#fn115" id="ref115">115</a></sup></p>

		<p>Alice Herz-Sommer expresses forced, purposeful optimism and refuses to take anything as bad; it shows us the ways in which survivors have coped with loss. It seems that in documentaries, many women survivors are intent on justifying the Holocaust as an experience that changed them for the better. As a woman&#146s narrative, this documentary does not express the stereotypical Holocaust experience that many filmmakers attempt to shoehorn &mdash; it should be noted that there is no typical experience. Every narrative made by a survivor is atypical, because survival was not the norm. Furthermore, the documentary doesn&#146t include too much detail about her life, other than her love of music and the documentary practically sells her optimism. However, this is what makes her testimony unique and powerful &mdash; her testimony helps to show the vast range of experience during the Holocaust. Certain prisoners were given privileges, camps had different or shifting policies, and Holocaust survivors in general emotionally understand their experiences in vastly different ways.</p>

<div class="Concluding_Remarks">
<h2 class="subheading" id="conclusion">Concluding Remarks</h2>

	<p>Quite rightly, Douglas Johnson, one of the few historians to review <cite>The World At War</cite> when it was first broadcast, expressed that history in film should not be judged the same as that presented in a book or lecture.<sup><a href="#fn116" id="ref116">116</a></sup> Documentaries do not get footnotes, the accompanying texts some directors release are rarely read to the same degree as the documentaries themselves are watched, and most films, if they belong to a series, are limited to a fifty minute length. Films for the classroom typically must be even shorter, around thirty or forty minutes long, so that attendance can be taken before the lesson and discussion of the film can take place. Also limiting is simply the average attention span &mdash; rarely does an individual have the capacity to subject themselves to a nine and a half hour long documentary. Many of the documentaries are also considered inappropriate for children, such as Resnais&#146s <cite>Night and Fog</cite>, which has graphic depictions of starvation, violence, and death, which prevents them from showing on daytime television. The scope of what can be covered in these documentaries is therefore limited. It is for this reason that we have seen documentaries evolve from very general depictions of the Holocaust into the very specific films we see today that focus on small groups of people and their specific stories.</p>

	<p>The Holocaust and its understanding by the public is further complicated by the fact that documentaries are not the only media which is informing the public. We also see the growing popularity of the docu-drama, from the late 1970s to today, although the Holocaust in television and popular culture would not really become popular until the 1990s. The most famous of these most recent docu-dramas is Spielberg&#146s <cite>Schindler&#146s List</cite>, and Polanski&#146s <cite>The Pianist</cite>, and Mark Herman&#146s historical drama, <cite>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</cite>. Tenuous lines divide a non-fictional account from a <q>based on true events</q> in these films. Historical drama films, such as Spielberg&#146s <cite>Schindler&#146s List</cite>, have included the testimonies of survivors into their narratives. For example, Spielberg&#146s <cite>Schindler&#146s List</cite>, has been heavily influenced by documentaries. Watching this Academy-Award winning film, it is easy to forget that Helena Hirsch was as much as real person as a character written by Steven Spielberg.</p>

	<p>The line between historical <q>fact</q> and fictional addition is completely blurred, especially with their reenactment of the Holocaust as a cinematographic presentation. Even within documentaries and historical art films, such as Laurence Rees&#146s <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite>, and Claude Lanzmann&#146s <cite>Shoah</cite>, that there is some degree of reenactment. Because many popular docu-drama and historical drama films include the memoirs of survivors or are created with the consultation of the survivors, they also have a <q>documentary</q> quality to them. Despite Claude Lanzmann&#146s rejection of the term <q>documentary</q> for <cite>Shoah</cite>, the film walks the fine line between them and many would argue that its educational qualities (or the drive for further education that the film may cause) lend itself to the category of documentary. No matter their narrative basis or the genre, these films paint a picture of the Holocaust that has left an indelible mark on the publics&#146 historical memory and has prescribed some historical meaning to the Holocaust which has historically excluded women from the overall narrative. It is exactly for this reason that documentaries and docu-dramas should be viewed with extreme scrutiny.</p>

	<p>Documentaries like <cite>The Nazis: A Warning From History</cite>, <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite>, and <cite>The World At War</cite>, which are available not just during film festivals or in classrooms are widely viewed on <abbr title="Public Broadcasting Service" class="abbr">PBS</abbr>, ITV, the <abbr title="British Broadcasting Network" class="abbr">BBC</abbr> and the History and Military Channel. These documentaries largely use male voices, and even <cite>Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State</cite> designates most of its time in describing the structure and operation of the <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> rather than survivor testimony. While hundreds of Holocaust documentaries exist, the most widely available and most currently popular of them actually devote very little time to the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, male and female. However, those documentaries which do give specific testimonies from both women and men tend to favor the voices of male survivors to women. The exclusion of women perpetuates a male-oriented body of common knowledge, where women&#146s issues are considered <q>special interest.</q> <strong>Women are not asked to give their recollections, despite the fact that many women swore to themselves that they would simply live to tell the world about what had been done to them. Women&#146s grieving has been downplayed and stilted by a rejection of their public mourning.</strong></p>

	<p>Documentaries rarely explore the intersection of antisemitism and sexism, despite the fact that women were directly targeted for extermination, both by <i lang="de">Einsatzgruppen</i> and upon arrival to camps. Some say that pregnant mothers were among the first gassed, fewer say that women were forced to have abortions or were sterilized, and not a single documentary (even among recent documentaries) that does address these topics bring up the terrible fear women had of becoming forever sterile because of the stress and starvation of the camp and the rumors that bromide was being put into their food. Women who survived by killing their children are not interviewed or their testimonies were not included, and women who had abortions or gave birth in the camps are not interviewed. Not a single woman in these documentaries expresses how she truely felt, being degendered by starvation and hair-shaving, humiliated by sexualized violence, and dehumanized by all of these things, leaving the ideas either completely unaddressed or floating about nebulously.</p>

	<p>Very rarely is hierarchical structure of the camps and the perpetration of crimes against fellow Jewish people addressed, and when it is addressed, it is always men giving testimony. No woman is ever interviewed for the choiceless choices she made simply to survive. There also seems to be an assumption that inmates cannot and did not commit terrible crimes against one another, or that in women&#146s camps women (<abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> and <i lang="de">Kapos</i>) were the sole perpetrators of crimes against women.</p>

	<p>It is only in the documentaries which have almost exclusively women, such as Moll&#146s <cite>The Last Days</cite>, or documentaries that focus on individual women, such as <cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite> or <cite>The Lady in Number 6</cite>, that we are given any insight about women&#146s relationships to other women within the camp. Surprisingly, all relationships given are platonic, which neglects the meaningful romantic and sexual relationships women had with one another. This is particularly strange given that most women&#146s narratives regularly cite other women as the reason why they lived &mdash; their cooperative friendships gave them not only the physical means to survive but the spiritual and emotional means. There is a trend amongst feminist thought, especially in Myrna Goldenberg&#146s work, to depict women as cooperative and drawing from the performance of their traditional gender roles a way to survive.<sup><a href="#fn117" id="ref117">117</a></sup> Both of these are indicative that survivors desperately wished to find something positive and life-affirming to their experiences. This reaction can likely be contributed to survivor&#146s guilt, which is also never addressed. <strong>Traumas are never addressed in how they affect the living people, men or women.</strong></p>

	<p>Perhaps due to the humiliation of the practice, the sex-based economy of the concentration camps are never discussed in the documentaries. Sex is only talked about in the context of rape &mdash; and it is always an <abbr title="Schutzstaffel" class="abbr">SS</abbr> man raping a Jewish woman. However, because sexual violence, in which women would be forced to strip naked for punishment, or upon arrival women were subjected to full-cavity searches by men, is never addressed in these documentaries, sexual violence is depicted as uncommon and especially aberrant, rather than a regular tool of dehumanization. Also never addressed by any filmmakers is sexual assault and rape perpetrated by inmates or the sexual assault and rape of women at the hands of those hiding them. It is understandable that a documentary would use a narrator to give this information, rather than a survivor, given the intense stigma directed towards rape victims and those who sell their bodies, but not even this is afforded. Exclusion of these topics weakens the narratives of early documentaries. By giving an incomplete picture of women&#146s lives, these documentaries fail to address how the Holocaust affected all people.</p>

	<p>These documentaries fail to address the underlying systems that already were at work against these women <em>before</em> their treatment by the Nazis. Practically all of the violence explored in these documentaries are seen as <q>exceptional</q> &mdash; rather than birthed, enabled and fueled by a specific underlying culture of violence towards women. They fail to address many of the material reasons why women suffered: the overwork of women in the home due to an devaluing of domestic labor and the lower pay of women in factories (also due to an undervaluing of womens&#146 labor, and the very knowing exploitation of that fact by Nazi factory owners). They fail to address or even ask why sexual violence against Jewish women was so rampant and perpetrated by both the Nazis and fellow inmates. Unfortunately, none of these oversights are particularly surprising: all of the directors of these documentaries are men.</p>

	<p>In the very earliest documentaries, such as Resnais&#146s <cite>Night and Fog</cite>, victims are treated as a monolith or crowd, rather than individuals with specific experiences. By the time <cite>The World At War</cite> is being made, historians and filmmakers are realizing the importance of testimonies. Lanzmann takes the survivor testimony to the furthest extreme, and from the 1980s onward, films are created centering primarily on interviews. Even in the past ten years the way filmmakers approach documentaries have vastly changed.</p>

	<p>We have seen an evolution in how survivors are represented, and specifically in how women are represented. During the 1990s, more filmmakers began to emphasize the narratives of individual survivors, and with the greater availability of translated narratives, began to include women&#146s specific experiences. Documentary filmmakers should aspire to make films such as Kary Antholis&#146s <cite>One Survivor Remembers</cite> and Malcome Clarke&#146s <cite>The Lady in Number 6</cite>, which focus on individuals, and James Moll&#146s impressive <cite>The Last Days</cite>. Sadly, many of the women who could tell us their stories are no longer alive to tell us their stories. However, countless hours of interviews already exist, largely unexamined by filmmakers for the distinct gendered experiences of women survivors. Given the trend in Holocaust filmmaking, a re-examination of this source material would be invaluable in the development of further educational materials that further explore the ways women have been materially oppressed and how this oppression was exploited by the Nazis.</p>
